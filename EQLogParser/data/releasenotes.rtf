\pard 
{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Added basic handling of unknown spells so that spell counts and the cast order should at least see them.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Updates spell list from latest game update.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Added Strike of Ice to proc list.\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Fix default Damage Meter width being way too big.\par

\fi-360\li720 Updated View Context from Log Search to more or less work for .gz files. It specifically grabs plus or minus 1000 lines from whatever it finds that matches.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Fix for creating an image from the ADPS/Tanking Timeline charts and updated the sizing when the charts are small.\par

\pard 
{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Added a new option that may be useful for Timer End Early messages. Basically, if you have settings in the Timer End section to Display Text or to Speak/Play a Sound and you do not want them to happen based on a Timer End Early pattern. You can specify \b\{null\} \b0 in the End Early Text to Display or Speak fields. Normally, the End Early message will override the message specified in the Timer End section but if you simply do not want a message at all.. This is the workaround. The triggerVariables doc is updated to try and explain it as it is a little confusing.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Fix for very short audio data sometimes causing playback to fail and stopping audio from working with triggers until restart.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Added some extra debug/error handling to the audio code to check for any more issues. Hopefully, this is now pretty stable for everyone.\par

{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}

\pard 
{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Updated the Trigger Tester to specify the character Active Color and Font color if specified. Also, updates to Active Color and Font handle some error cases better and won't break if transparent is accidentally selected.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Removed handling of Quick Shares from monitoring the main log file. If you use Advanced nothing changes. If you're using basic and turn Triggers off you will no longer get prompted.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Added Create WAV Audio option to Tools menu. It's a simple UI for exporting text to speak with the typical rate, voice, and volume settings.\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Made some minor changes to audio playback for wav files.\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}Updated Log Management Window and Trigger Config/Dictionary, and Message Windows to no longer appear in the task bar or be on top of other windows.\par

{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Updated parsing for EMU servers to include critical damage when related to direct damage and some melee including finishing blow and crippling blow.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Made small adjustment to NPC handling when neither player or npc is known. Look for a larger rework of this stuff, figuring out the fight list, etc in the future. Live works better because of the NPC list provided with the parser. Other servers with unique npcs may have more issues.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}\b Note One More Time \b0 that there is an \b EMU Parsing \b0 setting under the Options menu that now needs to be used when log files are from EMU/P99.\par

{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Updated Window style settings for Overlays and added some checks to try and enforce top most window. Hopefully, it helps with some conflicts when running with ISBoxer.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Updated damage parsing to catch a few cases that we\rquote re being missed. Things like falling damage are now counted and labeled Unknown and some reverse damage shield messages should be counted that weren't.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Updated damage parsing for EMU servers with some additional checks to support the \b Heroes Forge \b0 server. However, there is now a new\b  "EMU Server Parsing" selection under the Options menu\b0  that needs to be enabled if you're opening these older log files. There were a few cases that couldn't easily be figured out/handled automatically.\ul\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}\ulnone Updated Syncfusion to last version from 26.x. Includes varios bug fixes.\ul\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}\ulnone Added PDF versions of the Release Notes and Trigger Variables. Windows 11 Build 2611 removes Wordpad so there\rquote s good default RTF viewer so the PDF versions will be opened if you try to view them from the parser. The RTF versions are still installed if you want to look at them manually.\ul\par

\fi-360\li720 Fixed bug where sometimes the selected voice in Trigger Manager would not be the one used when one is played.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Added support for an alternative TTS engine. This is mostly for people running on Linux/Wine where the standard Windows version is not available. It requires an extra download and details are in the README section on github. \ul\par

{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Continued reworking Trigger and Overlay processing. Hopefully, there are some performance improvements for people with older PCs.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Turning on and off individual Triggers should no longer close Overlays. If a Timer is displayed and the associated Trigger is turned off, it should remove the Timer Bar from the Overlays using it. Note that no special case like this exists for Text Overlays. The old data will just need to timeout like normal.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Fixed handling of many Fast Countdown Timers running at the same time. They would often not count down quickly enough.\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Fixed sorting when using Cooldown Timers. All the options should work now instead of them always being forced to sort by the time displayed.\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}Fixed bug with Progress Timers where they would not display at zero seconds when using the Standardized Time setting. Also, fixed the display time.\par
{\pntext\f0 6.\tab}Updated Cooldown Overlays to remove Rest and Idle Timers when you manually Close Overlays as a way to clean up the window. If the Overlay pops back up based on a new Timer all the existing Active Timers should display. Even if they transitioned to Reset or Idle.\par
{\pntext\f0 7.\tab}Added a 2nd color to the Damage Meter used to highlight your Player.\par
{\pntext\f0 8.\tab}Fix Trigger Tester sometimes hanging after Stop is used multiple times.\par
{\pntext\f0 9.\tab}Fix for tooltip in the Fight list not showing the full count of time and hits.\par
{\pntext\f0 10.\tab}Fix cleanup of downloads from parser updates when the Downloads folder is customed.\par
{\pntext\f0 11.\tab}Updated UI related functions in various places to better use background threads. This includes the Damage Meter which may have been too much for some systems.\par

{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Updated dependency versions.\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Re-worked Trigger Processor and handling of Audio to hopefully reduce the chance of data being lost or Timers getting stuck. (this is still a work in-progress)\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}Fix for Import Overlay not loading the Imported styles right away. Previously you had to display the Overlay information or restart the parser for the Imported to display properly.\par
{\pntext\f0 6.\tab}Fix for old Timer information hanging around forever and slowly causing a performance problem over time.\par

\fi-360\li720 Fix for receiving GINA Quick Shares. It was failing if too many triggers were shared or if the contents were too large (like when containing wav files). Note that wav files are still not imported. Triggers that use them need to be updated manually afterwards.\par

{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Switched to the SoundTouch library for changing the speaking rate for audio triggers. This should allow them to work on older versions of Windows 10.\par

\fi-360\li720 Added support for \{counter\} or \{repeated\} to the main Text to Speak field in a Trigger and added a note about it in the Triggers document.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Added Vertical Alignment option to Overlays. This changes how the content of the Overlay displays. The options are Top, Center or Bottom. Timer Overlays default to Top and Text Overlays default to Bottom.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Fixed a bug where the Preview Overlay would keep old settings after selecting a new one and canceling the update.\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Fixed a bug in the Timeline/ADPS Charts where spells with cast messages were being counted as spells only the player sees. Which was different than how the Spell Counts UI was working.\par

\fi-360\li720 Updated ADPS/Timeline charts. Added drag and drop for the labels so you can change the order each rows shows up. Added chart scaling/zooming by using Control+ and Control- with the mouse wheel. Also, changed the CVS output to show simple time values in seconds from -90 instead of the crazy timestamps.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Add Font Sizes up to 18 and some additional font families. Reworked almost all the UI layout code related to size changes. Some things may be sized a bit differently but hopefully more consistent and readable for people who need it.\par

{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Fix for Damage Meter config being unusable with the light theme.\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}Fix for Triggers not working without an installed sound device. It should try to re-initialize audio when there is no device so adding a device after the fact should work.\par

\fi-360\li720 Added BackupUtil.exe to Program Files\\EQLogParser that can be used from the command line. It works similar to the Create Backup options. When running the application you pass it a --path for the directory you'd like the zip file to be created in and nothing else.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Updated the Restore process to handle error cases and roll back changes if needed.\par

\fi-360\li720 Re-worked trigger database to allow the it to be shared by multiple processors. This will make backups more reliable and if you start a second parser it no longer needs to disable triggers completely. Altough, changes won't be reflected immediately in both so I don't suggest making changes from two instances at once.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Updated the default filename when creating a backup.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Update for playing short wav files. If they're under 1 second they'll get cut short if another sound needs to play. This should improve playback for sounds commonly used for spammed messages in addition to having the lockout values added previously. This could be configurable if needed but if you want 'alert' sounds that may be spammed then make sure they're under 1 second long for best results.\par
{\pntext\f0 4.\tab}Added support for mp3 sound files.\par
{\pntext\f0 5.\tab}Fixed bug where Trigger Properties wouldn't reload the sound file list when files are added or removed from the directory.\par
{\pntext\f0 6.\tab}More performance updates related to async tasks, rendering overlays, and trigger database access. I hope everyone has a lot of CPU cores.\par

{\pntext\f0 1.\tab}{\*\pn\pnlvlbody\pnf0\pnindent0\pnstart1\pndec{\pntxta.}}
\fi-360\li720 Added additional Volume setting Triggers. If Increase by 80% is chosen then it will increase the current Volume level by that amount for just that Trigger. Note that the total percentage can not go above 100% or below 0%. So, if you're Volume defaults to 100% don't expect it to get any louder. You'll have to set your Default to something in the middle so that the increase/decrease percentage means something. It's done this way so that the Trigger Volume is always relative to your parser's Volume.\par
{\pntext\f0 2.\tab}Fix for Log Archive sometimes archiving the same file over and over again. The file Creation Date is now set by the parser when Archive happens. So far, it's been working.\par
{\pntext\f0 3.\tab}Added auto-delete of trigger database backup files that are created by LiteDB. There's a bug where it's not cleaning those files up on its own so I'm doing for now.\ul\par

Major Updates from Version 2.1\par
\par
\ulnone Basic Log Management feature\b0 . It is available under Tools -> Log Management. Check the box to enable archiving, choose a folder for the archived files, select options from the two dropdowns. It will attempt to archive files that meet those criteria whenever the parser is started, whenever you add/enable a character's triggers or when you open a file to display a parse. Note that it will not archive randomly during a raid and it will wait for the parse to finish loading before attempting to archive.\par
\par
\b Restore Open Views. \b0 The parser will remember and re-open many of the application's windows/tabs upon restart. This appliies to everything under the View menu except for log search.\ul\par
\par
\ulnone\b Look and Feel Menu Item under Options.\b0  It has settings for Font Size, Font Family, and the previous Themes. Only a limited number of options are available at this time and a number of changes were made throughou the UI for things to adjust sizes better.

{\pntext\f1\'B7\tab}\ulnone Added Phonetic Dictionary option to Trigger Manager. It's very simple as the TTS engine doesn't support anything too useful. However, you can specify a word to replace with another word or phrase by adding rows to the dictionary table. Adding too many entries could potentially slow processing so look out for that.\ul\par
